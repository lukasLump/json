        "abstract": "The first idea that i followed in this project was to built a machine which uses a webcam and open_CV as the input sensor.  The second idea was to build something and hide the camera, somthing like a drawing. It should be somehow mystical and creepy, like a drawing with lots of eyes, and one of them allways focusing on you."
